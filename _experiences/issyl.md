I investigated formal methods to guide the building of next-generation software systems. 
Some of these projects included finding adversarial examples for tumor segmentation models on MRI images,
showing robustness of a classifier to attack models using abstract interpretation, and a PyTorch implementation of 
a system called "Bridging Boolean and Quantitative Synthesis Using Smoothed Proof Search."
