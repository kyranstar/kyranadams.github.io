As Rice ended the semester early due to the coronavirus, the Rice Data Science Club put out a
[competition](https://datasci.rice.edu/chrp/) to "encourage all Rice students, grad and undergrad, to get involved in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
Due to my previous experience at competitions like datathons, we realized that in order for our project
to have "Impact," which was the judging criteria, we needed to both come up with interesting results
and present those results in an intuitive way.

My friends and I put together an interdisciplinary team with each person having a distinct 
set of skills including statistical modeling, R, frontend in R Shiny, and frontend in D3.js. 

The [github repository and full report is here.](https://github.com/connorrothschild/covid-mobility)
