At Rice, our senior design class in the Computer Science department is COMP 410. In COMP 410,
the entire class of juniors, seniors, and graduate students complete a project given by a company
client with virtually no help except previous years' weekly written journals.

Our project was given by Oil and Gas company Schlumberger, which has over 100,000 employees in 
120 countries. The goal was to reduce the company's employee training cost by implementing a cloud
based Virtual Reality (VR) training system.

The most important part of the class as a learning experience was that we were left with
no guidance besides help in the form of riddles from our professor, as a trial-by-fire. This meant
our organizational hierarchy, technologies, software development methods (agile, scrum), and communications
with the client were all left to us.

In this project, I was one of three people who were interested in being project-wide leaders. We split
ourselves into project owner, scrum master, and architecture lead, but often took overlapping roles
over the course of the project. Originally, the other 24 students were organized in a simple hierarchical
structure into three teams: backend, VR, and web app. As the project evolved and we realized our 
development was capped by problems such as lacking inter-team communication, we developed other
organizational structures such as inter-team committees for addressing certain aspects of our solution.

This course gave me my first experience of leadership in software development and all of the 
excitement, hours of grinding, and frustration that came along with it. 

One of the things I learned

Even though this class was difficult enough to lead in person, after school went online due to COVID-19,
communication and decision making were even more difficult.

Here is our final presentation.
