This is a video game modeled after the early video game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) for a 2015 Microsoft competition (News article from previous year). Our game was themed as a cross between the original game and pac-man, and won first place in all categories including creativity, scope, and polish.

The game was implemented in C#. It is a fully featured video game, featuring: 
 - Scene management with data loading  
 - Various debugging features such as a logging system  
 - A trivia mini-game  
 - A procedurally generated hexagonal map with A* path finding  
 - A leaderboard system 

This was a collaborative effort between seven team members. I was one of the two main programmers.
