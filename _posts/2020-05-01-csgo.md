For a final project in my data visualization class, I decided to make a [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964)
visualization. I'd been interested in a dataset from Counter Strike: Global Offensive matchmaking data and how
this data could potentially be used to guide strategy and decision making.

I first processed the data using a python script in the browser. Then, I downloaded the clustered data 
(discussed below) and performed the regressions in R. I then built the visualization in 
pure HTML/CSS/JS/D3.js.

While there are libraries for this such as [scrollstory](https://github.com/sjwilliams/scrollstory) by the NYT,
I wanted to implement it from scratch, as this was my first real time writing JS.

While making this, I realized how low-level D3.js actually is. It operates on pure SVG objects in the DOM,
which sometimes makes it difficult to do things, but also makes it possible to do anything. It allowed me to 
transition data visualizations into hand-made animations. However, due to how low level it was,
it became a lot slower than I intended and I could only render 10,000 out of the 100,000+ datapoints
I was using.

Here is the visualization ([click here to open in a new page](https://kyranstar.github.io/csgo.github.io/)):
