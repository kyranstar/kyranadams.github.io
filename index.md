                    abstract interpretation at Rice Intelligent Software Systems Lab, and worked with engineers at
                    Aerojet Rocketdyne to produce a liquid fueled rocket. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing Chopin on the piano, tinkering with algorithmic art, or
                    expanding my list of coffeeshop ratings."
