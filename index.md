description: "I'm a Senior at Rice University studying computer science and data science. I have interned with the
                    McNair Center to apply machine learning to economics research, done research on extensions of
                    abstract interpretation at Rice Intelligent Software Systems Lab, and worked with engineers at
                    Aerojet Rocketdyne to produce a liquid fueled rocket. When I'm not working, I enjoy playing Chopin on the piano, tinkering with algorithmic art, or
                    expanding my list of coffeeshop ratings."
